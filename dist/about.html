            <div class="bio">
                <p>
                    I found myself in <span class="text-secondary"><strong>coding.</strong></span><br><br>
                    I always thought my dream was to be a Civil Engineer. 
                    That was the only profession I know when I was in grade school. 
                    During my high school days, I always hate Mathematics and lost interest in pursuing Civil Engineering. 
                    I was doing well in high school but I think I am looking for something interesting. 
                    By that time, I am always playing games on a computer rental because I do not have my own pc.
                    <br><br>One time, I accidentally clicked the <span class="text-secondary"><strong>Developer Mode</strong></span> in a browser and got curious about what was written in it. 
                    Having no idea what is it, I researched it and that's when it happened; 
                    the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked my first HTML and CSS tutorial video. 
                    By that time I decided to take a <span class="text-secondary"><strong>BS in Information Technology</strong></span> in college. 
                    Exactly because at that time I have not decided yet what course I will take. 
                    Since then, I can't get enough. <span class="text-secondary"><strong>Front-end Web Development</strong></span> calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem-solving.
                    <br><br>I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. 
                    It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; 
                    I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flair intact.
                    <br><br>My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, responsive design principles, and web optimization. 
                    So far, I have <span class="text-secondary"><strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C Language, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS,</strong> </span> and <span class="text-secondary"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> under my belt. 
                    I've started learning Node.JS, MongoDB, and Express.JS. 
                    I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
