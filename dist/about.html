                <p>My name is John Anthony L. Balbin. I am a <span class="text-secondary">Software Engineer, Web Developer, and a Freelancer.</span> 
                    My passion for web development could be traced back to when I was a high school student. 
                    I am always curious about how the web works whenever I browse the internet. 
                    I am always excited to discover something new about it and that urged me to take <span class="text-secondary">Information Technology</span> in college. 
                    During that time, I learned different programming languages but still, <span class="text-secondary">web development</span> is my <span class="text-secondary">passion</span>. 
                    I created different web sites and applications during that time. 
                    <span class="text-secondary">Excitement</span> always fulfilled me when I'm about to start a new project and <span class="text-secondary">satisfaction</span> when I finished it with <span class="text-secondary">quality</span>. 
                    Now, even though I am already a professional,  I am always open to new learnings and knowledge in the field of IT. 
                    As a matter of fact, I enrolled in a course by <span class="text-secondary">Clever Programmer</span> called Profit With Javascript to improve my skills.</p>
