                <p>
                    I found myself in <span class="text-secondary">coding.</span><br><br>
                    I always thought my dream was to be a Civil Engineer. 
                    That was the only profession I know when I was in grade school. 
                    During my high school days, I always hate Mathematics and lost interest in pursuing Civil Engineering. 
                    I was doing well in high school but I think I am looking for something interesting. 
                    By that time, I am always playing games on a computer rental because I do not have my own pc.
                    <br><br>One time, I accidentally clicked the <span class="text-secondary">Developer Mode</span> in a browser and got curious about what was written in it. 
                    Having no idea what is it, I researched it and that's when it happened; 
                    the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked my first HTML and CSS tutorial video. 
                    By that time I decided to take a <span class="text-secondary">BS in Information Technology</span> in college. 
                    Exactly because at that time I have not decided yet what course I will take. 
                    Since then, I can't get enough. <span class="text-secondary">Front-end web development</span> calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem-solving.
                    <br><br>I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. 
                    It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; 
                    I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flair intact.
                    <br><br>My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, responsive design principles, and web optimization. 
                    So far, I have <span class="text-secondary"><strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C Language, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS,</strong> </span> and <span class="text-secondary"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> under my belt. 
                    I've started learning Node.JS, MongoDB, and Express.JS. 
                    I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.

                <p>
                    I worked in a Japanese Automotive Company as a Software Engineer.
                    My roles are unit tester, crosschecker, and document creator.
                    We make sure that the quality of every project that we are doing is 100%.
                    I believe that quality is the most important factor you can give to your customer to gain their
                    trust as well as to give them satisfaction.
                    My job is to always ensure the qualitty of the project that we do. I can also speak, read and
                    write the Japanese language. My Nihongo Level is N4.
